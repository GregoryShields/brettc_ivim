# This is my [iVim][ivim] setup.

There are numerous nice editors on the iPad (such as [Textastic][textastic]), but I missed using the muscle memory from years of working with [Vi(m)][vim]. [iVim][ivim] is an excellent port, and with the new support for [mapping hardware keyboards in iOS 3.4][capslock], it’s like typing on a real computer.

Configuring iVim is a little painful, however. I’ve come to rely on a bunch of plugins in recent years, keeping my `.vimrc` file relatively bare and offloading the complexity elsewhere. The iPadOS file system and tools, though more open than before, still don’t make configuring Vim as simple as on a Mac (or even a PC). I found some useful [guides online][faff], but I wanted an approach that was (a) easy, and (b) versioned.

Here’s where another fabulous iPad app steps in: [Working Copy][workingcopy], a git app for the iPad that is easier to use than the apps on the Mac (go buy this right now—it is awesome!).

Here are the steps:
